## Introduction

This dataset was created with the goal of focusing on the case study of COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation. As a result, from November 2020 to February 2021, we collected  COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation data from social media platforms. This dataset contains data for the following social platform domains:

* Instagram 
* Twitter
* YouTube
* News
* Reddit


**Note:**
The dataset in the repository  is augmented using the following techniques: 
* Contextual word embeddings are used to augment words by feeding surrounding words to the BERT language model. 
* The social media posts were translated into different languages and then back into English phrases. French, Japanese, German, and Urdu were the languages utilised in this technique.
